# CRITICAL SECURITY GUIDELINES FOR MALWARE ANALYSIS

## ⚠️ NEVER ALLOW REAL MALWARE TO EXECUTE

### What Happened:
- Real ransomware samples were present in TestScripts/malware_files/
- When allowed to execute, they deleted the GUI directory and began encrypting files
- System had to be restored from snapshot

### Mandatory Safety Measures:

#### 1. ISOLATED TESTING ENVIRONMENT
- Use completely isolated VMs with no network access
- No shared folders or clipboard between host and VM
- Take snapshots before ANY testing
- Use disposable VMs that can be destroyed after testing

#### 2. SAFE TEST FILES ONLY
- Replace all real malware samples with harmless simulators
- Use Python scripts that mimic suspicious behavior patterns
- Never use actual malware binaries for testing

#### 3. ANALYSIS-ONLY APPROACH
- Memory dumps should be analyzed in READ-ONLY mode
- Never execute processes found in memory dumps
- Use static analysis techniques only

#### 4. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
- Always have snapshot rollback ready
- Disconnect network immediately if infection suspected
- Have clean system images available for restoration

### Current Status:
✅ Real malware files quarantined to QUARANTINE folder
✅ Harmless test files being created as replacements
⚠️ System restored from snapshot after ransomware incident

### Next Steps:
1. Complete replacement of all test malware with safe simulators
2. Implement proper VM isolation for future testing
3. Add safety checks to prevent execution of real malware
4. Create read-only analysis workflows
